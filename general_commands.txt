🔹 Option 1: Restart Windows Explorer (Most Common & Useful)

This restarts:

Taskbar
File Explorer
Desktop
Many UI-related issues

Method A: Using Command Prompt or Powershell

Open Command Prompt and run:


taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
start explorer.exe


This:

Kills Explorer
Starts it again fresh

Very useful when:
	Taskbar freezes
	Start menu not responding
	UI glitches


Method B: Using Task Manager (No command)
	Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc
	Find Windows Explorer
	Right-click → Restart
	This is the cleanest UI-level restart.




🔹 Option 2: Restart All User Apps (Log Off & Back In)

This closes:
	All user apps
	Restarts your user session
	But does not reboot the PC

Command:

shutdown /l


This logs you out, then you log back in.

This is the closest to:

“Restart everything except the actual power cycle.”

🔹 Option 3: Restart Specific System Services (Advanced)

For example, restart Windows Audio:

net stop audiosrv
net start audiosrv


Or restart networking:

ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew


Useful if only one part of the system is misbehaving.

❗ Important Truth

There is no safe way to:
	Fully reset all system state
	Clear kernel memory
	Reload drivers

without an actual reboot.
Some things (drivers, kernel, low-level services) only reset on reboot.



When apps are acting strange:

First try:

taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
start explorer.exe


If that fails:

shutdown /l


(log out & log back in)

If still bad:
→ Do a full restart.




✅ How to Run It from Git Bash (Correct Way)

Use this:

cmd.exe /c shutdown /l



🔹 Same for Explorer Restart from Git Bash
If you want to restart Explorer from Git Bash:
